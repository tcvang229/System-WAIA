# System-Web Speec API Assistant (W.A.I.A)
Web Speech API for Google Chrome -- voice commands for web page accessibility or generic Google searches

# Motivation
System-WAIA is the evolutionized product of my first real web page. The main reason why I developed the web
page was to give me better accessiblity to the places I wanted to go on the web. Soon, I realized that buttons
with hyperlinks is as limited as to the specific URL that it takes you to-- I'd have to create a new button
every time I wanted a new link. System-WAIA doesn't require that.

System-WAIA is able to connect the user to a URL without having to create buttons that will stain the web page.
It allows dynamic searches, unlike my original web page.
