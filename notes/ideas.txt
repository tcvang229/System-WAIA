with the original state of WAIA, project is arguably considered a "Good, Old-Fashined AI (GOFAI)"

GOALS
	- once understanding material, be able to give her own opinion or paraphrase
	without just stealing the text/data and spitting it out
		- WAIA takes weather data => understands that it is bad weather
		- "Show me the weather" => "THE WEATHER LOOKS PRETTY BAD. RIGHT NOW, 
		THE FOX VALLEY CITIES ARE EXPERIENCING A SNOW STORM CALLED BRODY. I 
		could notify your boss that the driving conditions may be severe and 
		you'll be late to work."
		- use weather API to receive data, store them into a dataframe, then
		use that dataframe for machine learning

	- should be able to make decisions for the user
		- her responses to the initial command that was given by the user 
		- "Show me the weather" => "The weather looks pretty bad. Right now, 
		the Fox Valley cities are experiencing a snow storm called Brody. I 
		COULD NOTIFY YOUR BOSS THAT THE DRIVING CONDITIONS MAY BE SEVERE AND 
		YOU'LL BE LATE TO WORK."
		- gonna have to figure out what kind of data that will be in this
		dataframe for WAIA to make those decisions based upon the user's
		commands


Decision Trees vs Neural Networks?
	- DT requires some type of model that at an input at the root of the tree
	will trickle down to some leaf node
	- DT requires dataset
	- DT model would mean that taking 1 object (1 input) what is the outcome?
		- WAIA would judge how important the user's command is
		- e.g.: "When is my daughter's birthday?" => "It is on January 29. 
		This seems important, would you like me to put it on your schedule?"
	- NN requires layers and some sort of activation functions
	- NN will help classify and cluster data
	- take a look at Tensor Flow
	- e.g.: learning about the things that I do and categorize them... what is important 
	// what isn't important // what do i prefer // what don't I prefer



# NN supposedly doesn't require much data, but DT does
# refer back to AI course... lots of data for DT

LIFE CYCLE
	- start with Electron framework, get front-end and back-end working
	- do I use JS or Python for algorithms? maybe JS for back-end, front-end, and AI
		- easier
	- bring in weather API
		- WAIA will require internet connection
